# Inter-VM-Real-Time-Communication
- QEMU starts the VM with command -memory-backend-file,id=shmmem-shmem0,mem-path=/dev/shm/lzh,size=33554432,share=yes -device ivshmem-plain,id=shmem0,memdev=shmmem-shmem0  
- -object memory-backend-file,id=shmmem-shmem0,mem-path=/dev/shm/lzh,size=33554432,share=yes: Create a memory back-end device file with a specified size of 32 MB and save the file to /dev/shm/lzh on the Host OS.
-device ivshmem-plain,id=shmem0,memdev=shmmem-shmem0 indicates that QEMU creates an ivshmem-plain device through the memory back-end device.  
- After starting the VM by adding the above instruction QEMU, a PCI device with 32M memory size is created. We still need to add the ivshmem device driver to the VM to enable the device. The make command executes the makefile file to compile the ivshmem.c file to get the kernel module file ivshmem.ko file, which is the device driver for ivshmem. Load the kernel module to run in the kernel using sudo insmod ivshmem.ko. Create a file device /dev/ivshmem0 for programming use, through the file read and write to achieve the shared memory read and writeã€‚
